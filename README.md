# Web Scraping and Information Extraction projects

Welcome to my Web Scraping repository! This collection of projects demonstrates proficiency in extracting, processing, and structuring information from various unstructured sources for subsequent business use. The projects cover a range of techniques and tools including regular expressions (RegEx), web scraping with libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium, web data processing, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and MongoDB (NoSQL). Additionally, the projects involve connecting to SQL databases to store and retrieve structured data for analysis. By leveraging these methods, the projects aim to automate the extraction of structured data from unstructured sources such as text documents, websites, or APIs. From parsing and extracting information to storing and analyzing data, these projects demonstrate the practical application of information extraction and processing techniques in generating actionable insights for business decision-making.
